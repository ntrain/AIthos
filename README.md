# AIthos
AIthos is a values-driven chatbot that listens with empathy, responds with respect, and fosters meaningful conversation. Designed to be ethical and emotionally aware, it bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and human connection.

## About The Project
There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it
Here's why:
- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life
